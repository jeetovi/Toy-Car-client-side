                  We have created a car database and our goal is for it to
                  contain all kinds of data regarding cars. The purpose of the
                  database is to make the car market more transparent and less
                  complicated. Examples of data are car specifications,
                  classifieds, mileages and reviews. By structuring the data, we
                  want to make it easier to find the right car, make correct car
                  valuations, compare statistics, confirm a history and find the
                  right accessories. The target group is everyone that has
                  anything to do with cars, such as owners, buyers and sellers â€“
                  both consumers and those that in any way work in the industry.
                  We realise that it is a large and extensive task to build a
                  car information website and we greatly appreciate suggestions
                  on how we can improve.
